# Providers and plugins regression notes

## Floating plugin UI must escape a host container that hides its overflow

- **Trap:** The Vim HUD renders in the strip just above its mount. DeepSeek's
  composer card sets `overflow: hidden` two levels above the textarea, so the
  badge was laid out correctly and clipped to nothing — no error, no empty
  element, simply never on screen.
- **Rule:** Before mounting UI that draws outside its mount's box, climb past any
  ancestor whose `overflow` is not `visible` and whose own edge is close enough
  to swallow it (`pages/content/chatInput/vimComposerMount.ts`). Do it by
  measuring, not by naming the site: the next host will clip somewhere else.
- **Guard:** `src/pages/content/chatInput/__tests__/vimComposerMount.test.ts`
  (`climbs out of a composer card that would clip the badge above it`).

## A delayed navigator star read must not replace the current conversation

- **Trap:** A storage-triggered star read from conversation A can resolve after
  navigation to B, replacing B's starred markers with A's snapshot (DeepSeek #996).
- **Rule:** Apply a star snapshot only if its request is the newest, its route
  still matches, and its plugin scope is alive. Preserve the existing startup
  promise chain so observers are installed at the same point in the lifecycle.
- **Guard:** `src/features/plugins/verbs/turnNavigatorStarIsolation.test.ts`
  reproduces A resolving after B;
  `src/features/plugins/verbs/turnNavigator/starSnapshot.test.ts` guards invalidation.

or prompt commands.

## Remote plugin catalog checks are triggered only by pages an enabled plugin targets

- **Trap:** The plugin host starts on every injected page, including Gemini, AI Studio and
  Claude's per-artifact `*.frame.claudeusercontent.com` iframes. A catalog check keyed on
  `location.host` from every start would contact voyager.nagi.fun from Gemini (breaking the
  zero-request promise) and would produce one 404 plus one storage key per random artifact
  frame host.
- **Rule:** Only the top frame asks the background for a check, only when
  `hasEnabledPluginForUrl` is true for the page, and only for a plain hostname
  (`isEligibleCatalogHost`); the background re-checks eligibility and the user's switch,
  interval and backoff before any fetch. Manual checks from the popup bypass the interval, not
  the host-shape rule.
- **Guard:** `src/features/plugins/runtime/PluginHost.test.ts` (`PluginHost remote catalog`),
  `src/features/plugins/remote/hostCatalogPolicy.test.ts`,
  `src/features/plugins/remote/hostCatalogRefresh.test.ts` (`ineligible` case).

## Turn-navigator conversation ids are namespaced by site

- **Trap:** The Claude timeline stored starred messages under `claude:conv:<id>` with the prefix
  hard-coded. Reusing that engine on DeepSeek with the prefix left as-is (or dropped) would file
  DeepSeek stars under Claude ids, and two sites whose route ids collide would corrupt each
  other's stars. The Gemini timeline has the same rule (`gemini:conv:<id>`).
- **Rule:** `TurnNavigator` builds ids from `TurnNavigatorConfig.siteId` plus the site's
  `conversationIdPattern`; the `turnNavigator` primitive takes both from the site adapter. Claude's
  config reproduces the historical `claude:conv:<id>` exactly, so existing stars keep resolving.
- **Guard:** `src/features/plugins/verbs/turnNavigator.test.ts` (`namespaces conversation ids`),
  `src/features/plugins/builtin/claudeTimeline/index.test.ts` (`builds Claude-scoped conversation
and turn ids`).

## A builtin with a `native` op must not also be bound as a native handler

- **Trap:** `verifyNativeHandlerBindings` used to require one handler per builtin id. After the
  formula-copy, Vim and timeline builtins switched to `native` ops, keeping their id bindings would
  run the feature twice (once through the primitive, once through the handler) and a missing
  binding would log a wiring error for a plugin that needs none.
- **Rule:** `NATIVE_BUILTIN_PLUGIN_IDS` lists only builtins without native ops; a manifest gets
  either a `native` op or a handler binding, never both.
- **Guard:** `src/features/plugins/builtin/builtin.test.ts` (native-op expectations) and the
  binding verification in `src/pages/content/pluginNativeRegistration.ts` at startup.

## A primitive-backed plugin keeps its mounted version until the page reloads

- **Trap:** A catalog refresh remounts declarative plugins live, which is right for CSS and DOM
  ops. Doing the same for a plugin whose `native` op runs first-party code (formula copy, later
  the timeline) would tear down and restart JS with user-visible state mid-session, and a
  half-disposed scope racing a new activation is exactly the class of bug PluginScope exists to
  prevent.
- **Rule:** `PluginHost.reloadCatalog` pins a mounted plugin that has (or gains) a `native` op
  when its version or contributions change, reports `pendingVersion` in its status, and applies
  the new manifest only on the next full page load; declarative plugins remount immediately.
- **Guard:** `src/features/plugins/runtime/PluginHost.status.test.ts` (`keeps a primitive-backed
plugin on its mounted version`, `remounts a declarative plugin immediately`).

## The health signal must not report on an empty page or from a second observer

- **Trap:** "This plugin found nothing to act on" is only meaningful once the conversation has
  rendered. Evaluating on a fixed timer flags every plugin on a slow network, and evaluating on an
  empty conversation flags every plugin on a new chat. A second MutationObserver for the signal
  also broke the engine's invariant of observing only while a plugin has DOM ops.
- **Rule:** The engine's single observer feeds `HealthMonitor.noteMutation`; a verdict waits for a
  quiet period (the deadline only caps the first wait), requires `userTurn` matches > 0, counts
  targets from DOM ops plus primitive counters, and pure-CSS plugins are never tracked.
- **Guard:** `src/features/plugins/runtime/healthMonitor.test.ts`,
  `src/features/plugins/runtime/declarativeEngine.native.test.ts` (health cases),
  `src/features/plugins/runtime/declarativeEngine.test.ts` (`installs a MutationObserver only
while an active plugin has domOps`).

## Catalog CSS must be read for real under Vitest

- **Trap:** Vitest replaces every CSS import with an empty module unless the file matches
  `test.css.include`, and that stub wins over a `?raw` query too. The bundled plugins loaded
  under test therefore carried empty `contributes.styles[].css` for months without any assertion
  noticing; a lifecycle test that checks the injected style text would have passed on nothing.
- **Rule:** Keep `css.include` in `vitest.config.ts` matching
  `src/features/plugins/catalog/**/*.css` with an optional `?raw` suffix; assert CSS content
  through the loaded manifest, not only through `readFileSync`.
- **Guard:** `src/features/plugins/sources/bundledPluginsLifecycle.test.ts` (injected style text
  is non-empty) and `src/features/plugins/catalog/sites/index.test.ts` (discovered style files
  are non-empty).

## A missing or failed remote catalog must never unmount bundled plugins

- **Trap:** The remote catalog is authoritative for a host (a bundled plugin it no longer lists is
  dropped). Treating a 404, a network failure, or an entry written by another extension version as
  "the remote says this plugin is gone" would silently disable every user's plugins the moment the
  deploy, the CDN or the build lags behind the extension release.
- **Rule:** Only a valid `format: 1` file for the same host, fetched by the running extension
  version, is authoritative. 404 is cached as `missing`, failures keep the previous entry and only
  bump the attempt bookkeeping, and both fall back to the bundled snapshot. Cache writes that do not
  change the plugin set must not notify subscribers, or every failed attempt would remount CSS.
- **Guard:** `src/features/plugins/sources/defaultSources.test.ts` (`mergePluginRecords`),
  `src/features/plugins/remote/HostCatalogSource.test.ts`,
  `src/features/plugins/remote/hostCatalogCache.test.ts` (`subscribeHostCatalog`),
  `src/features/plugins/remote/hostCatalogRefresh.test.ts` (404 and failure cases).

## ChatGPT virtual shells must be repositioned after height reconciliation

- **Trap:** Exporting a cold, long ChatGPT conversation could fail with
  `chatgpt_export_message_unavailable:<turn-id>` even though the selected message was present and
  became exportable after manually scrolling to it. The materializer called `scrollIntoView()` only
  once. Mounting nearby turns made ChatGPT replace estimated virtual-shell heights with measured
  heights, which could move the requested shell several viewports away before it mounted. The
  remaining timeout loop only polled the offscreen shell and never corrected its position.
- **Rule:** While a requested shell remains unmounted, re-anchor it at a throttled interval only
  when height reconciliation has moved it outside the viewport.
- **Guard:** `src/pages/content/export/adapter/__tests__/chatgpt.test.ts`
  (`repositions a virtual shell that moves offscreen after height reconciliation`).

## ChatGPT bookkeeping roots and message-less turns must not abort the export

- **Trap:** Exporting a ChatGPT conversation opened from history failed with
  `chatgpt_export_message_unavailable:paginated-root:<conversation-id>`, surfaced to the user as the
  generic "refresh and retry" alert, and select mode showed a phantom checkbox above the first
  message. ChatGPT stores its virtual-list roots in the same `data-turn-id-container` attribute as
  turns: `client-created-root` for a conversation started in the tab and `paginated-root:<id>` for
  one opened from history; only the first was excluded. A turn whose response rendered nothing
  (`section[data-turn="assistant"]` without any `[data-message-author-role]`) then hit the same
  timeout because it looked like an unmounted virtual shell.
- **Rule:** Skip every `*-root` container. Resolve the role from `[data-turn]` when no message root
  exists, and once a mounted frame stays message-less through the settle window treat the turn as
  empty: count it as handled, export nothing for it, and keep pairing sequence-based so the
  preceding prompt becomes a user-only turn. A frame-less shell must still time out.
- **Guard:** `src/pages/content/export/adapter/__tests__/chatgpt.test.ts`
  (`ignores the paginated history root the same way`,
  `resolves the role from the turn frame when ChatGPT renders a turn without a message`,
  `skips a rendered turn without a message instead of failing the export`,
  `fails when a selected virtual shell never mounts`).

## ChatGPT export entry point only where a conversation can exist

- **Trap:** The ChatGPT export plugin matches the whole origin, and the persistent toolbar was
  mounted as soon as the plugin started, so it also appeared on Codex, settings and library pages
  where nothing can be exported, and stayed there as the SPA moved between such pages and chats.
- **Rule:** Platforms whose chat UI shares an origin with unrelated pages implement
  `isConversationPage(doc, url)` on their export adapter; `startExportEntryGate` mounts the entry
  point only while it returns true and re-checks on route changes and settled DOM mutations. For
  ChatGPT that is a `/c/<id>` route (optionally under `/u/<n>/` or `/g/<gpt>/`) or a rendered
  turn, because a temporary chat keeps `/?temporary-chat=true`.
- **Guard:** `src/pages/content/export/adapter/__tests__/chatgpt.test.ts`
  (`chatgptIsConversationPage`), `src/pages/content/export/__tests__/exportEntryGate.test.ts`.

## ChatGPT export toolbar must avoid the native header cluster

- **Trap:** The ChatGPT persistent export button sat at `top: 50px` / `right: 84px` and covered
  Share, the more menu, or the conversation title. Avoidance only knew Gemini top-bar selectors, so
  ChatGPT header actions never pushed the toolbar left. ChatGPT later rendered header controls
  without those ids and test ids, so the list matched nothing and the button fell back to
  `right: 84px` over Share again (#1044); open canvas panels add header controls the list never
  named.
- **Rule:** Keep the ChatGPT toolbar on the header row and include `#conversation-header-actions`
  plus Share / conversation-options in the top-right avoidance list. On ChatGPT the toolbar also
  hit-tests its own row and moves left of any button, link or `role="button"` rendered there, so
  it does not depend on host markup.
- **Guard:** `src/pages/content/export/__tests__/persistentExportToolbar.test.ts`
  (`moves left to avoid ChatGPT header share actions`,
  `moves left of unlabeled header controls rendered under the ChatGPT toolbar`).

## ChatGPT export UI must belong to the active plugin lifecycle

- **Trap:** Rapidly disabling and re-enabling the ChatGPT exporter could let a stale startup remove
  the replacement toolbar. Disabling while export preferences were still loading could also show a
  dialog after the plugin was already off. Asynchronous startup and dialog loading were not tied to
  an abortable plugin lifecycle, while repeated toolbar mounts shared one DOM root without
  ownership.
- **Rule:** Pass the plugin lifecycle signal through startup and dialog loading, replace the shared
  toolbar's click handler on remount, and allow only the current owner to remove the shared root.
- **Guard:** `src/features/plugins/builtin/chatgptExport/runtime.test.ts`
  (`aborts the stale lifecycle before starting a replacement`) and
  `src/pages/content/export/__tests__/persistentExportToolbar.test.ts`
  (`does not duplicate-mount; second call updates text on existing instance`).

## Temporary-chat handoff state must stay private and tab-scoped

- **Trap:** ChatGPT can reuse its composer, expose unrelated textboxes, replace the accepted
  composer later, or render multiline text differently from `textContent`. Page `sessionStorage`,
  node-replacement assumptions, and broad async guards let payloads leak across editors, vanish
  during hard navigation, replay after cancellation, or restore a late attachment after the user
  edited the composer.
- **Rule:** Resolve ChatGPT composers in selector-priority order and accept a usable same-node
  composer. Keep transcripts in extension storage behind expiring tab-scoped tokens. Bind delivered
  recovery to the exact chat route and cancel it on route mismatch, edit, send, native New Chat,
  plugin disposal, or expiry. Carry a synchronous cancellation revision across async storage,
  insertion, and preview work. Mark hard navigation before root teardown, keep progress mounted
  through departure bookkeeping, sweep expired keys, and suppress cancellation only around the
  plugin's synchronous navigation clicks. Fail closed during generation, an incomplete final user
  turn, or a turn-identity change during collection.
- **Guard:** `src/features/plugins/builtin/chatgptTemporaryHandoff/handoff.test.ts` and
  `src/features/plugins/builtin/chatgptTemporaryHandoff/index.test.ts` cover composer reuse and
  isolation, multiline verification, route-bound recovery, cancellation at every async boundary,
  hard navigation, expiry, generation and turn guards, and attachment preview races.

## Temporary-chat handoff attachments need unique names

- **Trap:** A second long temporary-chat handoff could reuse the first attachment preview and insert
  only the new instruction, silently handing the old transcript to the new chat. Attachment recovery
  treats a visible matching filename as proof that the file was already delivered, while the
  original filename contained only the date.
- **Rule:** Give every handoff a timestamp plus nonce and reuse that identity for both the
  downloaded backup and the composer attachment.
- **Guard:** `src/features/plugins/builtin/chatgptTemporaryHandoff/handoff.test.ts`
  (`gives separate handoffs unique filenames even at the same instant`).

## Claude usage settings hash may not open the modal by itself

- **Trap:** Clicking the Claude usage link changed the URL hash to `#settings/usage`, but the usage
  modal did not open until the page was refreshed. Claude's SPA sometimes observes the usage hash
  only during load. A hash-only navigation on an existing chat path is not always enough to mount
  the settings modal.
- **Rule:** Keep the current chat path in the usage URL and reload only when usage content does not
  appear after opening.
- **Guard:** `src/features/plugins/builtin/claudeUsage/index.test.ts`

## Claude usage reset data can come from multiple surfaces

- **Trap:** The Claude usage bar showed percentages but missed the reset countdown, especially for
  the 5h window. The visible settings DOM and the usage API do not always expose the same reset
  data. Some 5h reset information arrives through `message_limit` events.
- **Rule:** Normalize usage API windows, visible settings DOM, cached snapshots, and `message_limit`
  events into the same metric shape.
- **Guard:** `src/features/plugins/builtin/claudeUsage/index.test.ts`
  `src/features/plugins/builtin/claudeUsage/observer.test.ts`

## Duplicate prompt names are a slash eligibility conflict, not invalid data

- **Trap:** Import or sync dropped Prompt records when names collided, while slash completion
  accepted every non-empty name and made historical duplicates ambiguous. Parallel Drive timestamp
  merges could also let a newer legacy record without `name` erase the local name.
- **Rule:** Preserve every Prompt record. Group names by one shared trimmed, NFKC-normalized,
  case-insensitive key; exclude the whole duplicate group from slash completion and show a
  non-blocking Prompt Manager badge until resolved. Route every Drive merge through the shared
  helper, which retains a local name when the newer cloud record predates prompt names.
- **Guard:** `src/features/backup/services/__tests__/PromptImportExportService.test.ts`
  `src/utils/merge.test.ts` `src/pages/content/folder/__tests__/FolderTransferController.test.ts`
  `src/pages/content/folder/__tests__/aistudioAuditFixes.test.ts`
  `src/pages/content/prompt/__tests__/promptName.test.ts`
  `src/pages/content/prompt/__tests__/slashPrompt.test.ts`
  `src/pages/background/__tests__/runtimeMessageRouting.test.ts`

## D18 scope checks compare match patterns, never one probe URL

- **Trap:** The catalog build and `plugin:check` proved "plugin `matches` stay inside the site" by
  probing one URL derived from the plugin pattern. `https://*.example.com/*` probed as
  `https://x.example.com/` and passed under a site that only covers `x.example.com`, although the
  plugin also applies to every other subdomain; `*://` probed as https and passed an https-only
  site.
- **Rule:** Use `patternWithin` / `patternWithinAny` from `sites/matchPattern.ts`: scheme, host
  wildcard and path scope are compared part by part, so a plugin scope must be the site scope or
  narrower.
- **Guard:** `src/features/plugins/sites/matchPattern.test.ts`
  (`rejects a wildcard host, a wider scheme or a wider path than the site allows`).

## Prompt Manager coverage on plugin platforms listens before it mounts

- **Trap:** The content script mounted the Prompt Manager from the startup coverage read and only
  then registered the storage listener. A user switching the site off while that read or the
  first mount was in flight was missed, and the Prompt Manager stayed mounted until a reload.
- **Rule:** Create the reconciler, register `handleChange`, then feed the startup read through
  `applyInitial()`; it is queued behind any change already handled and ignored when the listener
  has already seen a newer value.
- **Guard:** `src/pages/content/prompt/__tests__/customSiteCoverage.test.ts`
  (`queues a toggle-off that lands while the startup mount is in flight`,
  `ignores a startup read that is older than a change already handled`).

## Data-supplied regular expressions follow the safe subset

- **Trap:** `conversationIdPattern` reaches the content thread from site.json, plugin params and
  the remote catalog, and `turnNavigator` executed it against the URL path after a syntax check
  only. A pattern such as `^/(a+)+$` backtracks exponentially: a remote catalog entry could stall
  every page of that host.
- **Rule:** Validate with `isSafeRegexSource` (`sites/safeRegex.ts`): no lookarounds, no
  backreferences, no `*`/`+`/`{…}` repetition of a group that holds a quantifier or an alternation
  at any depth (`(a+)+`, `((a+))+`, `(a|aa)+`; a regex on the source misses the nested and
  alternation forms, so the check is a small scanner), at most 200 characters and at most
  `MAX_SAFE_REGEX_QUANTIFIERS` quantifiers (adjacent `a*a*…` terms are polynomial with the count as
  the exponent); bound the subject with `MAX_REGEX_INPUT_LENGTH`. This is defence in depth for a
  catalog the project publishes itself, not a proof of bounded matching cost. Apply the same policy
  wherever a pattern comes from data.
- **Guard:** `src/features/plugins/sites/safeRegex.test.ts`,
  `src/features/plugins/verbs/turnNavigator.test.ts`
  (`validates selectors, the id pattern and the rail side`).

## Plugin content-script registration must unregister only registered ids

- **Trap:** The plugin sync batched the plugin, embedded-frame and Claude-usage script ids into
  one `unregisterContentScripts` call. Chrome rejects the whole call when any id is unknown, and
  the following `registerContentScripts` then failed on the duplicate id, so the registration
  froze on the first result of a session: enabling DeepSeek plugins after ChatGPT/Claude were
  already registered changed nothing until the extension restarted, and the popup showed the
  toggles on with no site injected.
- **Rule:** Before unregistering, list the registered scripts and unregister only the ids that
  exist (`src/pages/background/contentScriptRegistration.ts`). Never batch a possibly-absent
  companion id into an unregister call.
- **Guard:** `src/pages/background/__tests__/contentScriptRegistration.test.ts`
  (`drops only the ids that exist so a never-registered companion cannot block the batch`).

## The docs plugin store imports the extension's logos and builtin plugins

- **Trap:** The docs store kept hand copies of the platform marks and of the builtin plugin list.
  When DeepSeek plugins shipped, their cards fell back to a generic puzzle icon and did not merge
  with the same feature elsewhere; the builtin copy still listed two of five plugins, so Vim Input
  showed as DeepSeek-only although Claude and ChatGPT had it too.
- **Rule:** Docs components import `PLATFORM_LOGOS` (`src/core/icons/platformLogos.ts`) and
  `BUILTIN_PLUGINS` (`src/features/plugins/builtin/index.ts`) and only add the host list
  (`docs/.vitepress/theme/components/pluginStore.ts`). Never hand-copy extension data into the
  docs; a new platform needs its host there before its plugins appear correctly.
- **Guard:** `docs/.vitepress/theme/components/pluginCatalog.test.ts`
  (`gives every catalog plugin a known platform`, `folds every platform of Vim Input into one card`).
