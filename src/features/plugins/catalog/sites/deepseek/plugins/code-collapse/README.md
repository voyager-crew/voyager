# DeepSeek Code Folding

PR #1036 implements #1015. The contributor reports that the controls appear on
DeepSeek, but screenshots, browser-version details and the full live workflows
below are still pending. Neither synthetic fixtures nor a passing build prove
live-site compatibility or maintainer approval of the new primitive contract.

## Behavior

- Calls the generic `codeCollapse` primitive, introduced in engine 1.5.0.
- Optional `code` selector targets `pre` elements. Without it, queries `pre`
  inside the adapter's `assistantTurn` matches, including selector lists.
  Default targeting excludes the adapter's `thinkingBlock`; an explicit
  `code` selector can intentionally include reasoning code.
- Optional `thresholdLines` number: default 20, inclusive bounds 5 through 200.
  The plugin's numeric setting overrides the primitive default and updates in place.
- Folds only when code exceeds the threshold. Toggles and an expand-all/collapse-all
  button group are siblings, in normal document flow, with bundled Lucide icons,
  localized tooltips and accessible labels in all ten supported languages.
- Never moves or replaces host code nodes and never shortens their text. Only
  `pre` gets temporary height/overflow styles; native sibling copy controls remain
  untouched. Skips editable targets and blocks with controls inside `pre`.
  Reading is bounded to 200,000 characters and 10,000 descendant nodes per block;
  oversized blocks are left fully visible, without changing their content.
  A pixel-height fallback precedes the optional `lh` clamp on supporting browsers.
- Appended streaming text and syntax-highlight replacement with unchanged text
  preserve the user's decision. Detached, moved, non-prefix-rewritten or newly
  navigated targets release old controls and reset the decision.
- Disabling restores original inline values and priorities, including the exact
  original style attribute when the host has not independently edited it. Host
  updates to managed or unrelated inline declarations are retained.

## Integration

The same PR includes this plugin, the primitive contract and registration,
parameter baseline, engine 1.5.0 and marketplace entry. It remains opt-in.

## Verification still required

- Real DeepSeek conversation with long code and streaming, light and dark themes.
- Original copy buttons copy the full original code, while folded and expanded.
- Individual and all-block controls, numeric setting changes, navigation, disable,
  re-enable, and extension reload, without duplicate controls or host UI overlap.
- Narrow and wide layouts; live screenshots and nonzero target counts.
- Applicable loaded-extension browser checks from the contribution workflow.

Two-site parametric fixtures live in `verbs/codeCollapse.test.ts`. They are
synthetic regression tests, not recordings of the current DeepSeek DOM.
